# Expense Analysis & Spending Insights

## Overview

Sure provides powerful tools to analyze your spending habits, identify patterns, and make informed financial decisions. This guide covers how to extract maximum value from your transaction data.

## Quick Start: Getting Insights

### Using the AI Assistant (Recommended)

The fastest way to get spending insights is through the AI chat assistant:

**Basic Queries:**
```
"How much did I spend last month?"
"What are my top 5 spending categories?"
"Show me my spending on restaurants this year"
"Compare my spending this month vs last month"
```

**Advanced Analysis:**
```
"What are my spending trends over the last 6 months?"
"Show me unusual transactions in the last week"
"Which categories am I overspending in?"
"How much do I spend on average per month on groceries?"
"Am I spending more on dining out or groceries?"
```

**Forecasting:**
```
"Based on my current spending, when will I reach $10,000 in savings?"
"If I continue spending like this, what will my balance be in 6 months?"
"What's my projected annual spending on transportation?"
```

### Using Reports & Dashboards

For visual analysis:

1. **Dashboard**: Quick overview of spending vs. income, budget progress
2. **Reports**: Detailed breakdowns by category, merchant, time period
3. **Charts**: Visual representation of trends and distributions

## Spending Analysis Techniques

### 1. Category Analysis

**Purpose:** Understand where your money goes

**How to:**
1. Navigate to **Transactions** → **Categories**
2. Select a time period (month, quarter, year)
3. View category breakdown chart
4. Click on a category to see all transactions

**What to Look For:**
- **Largest categories**: Where most money goes
- **Surprising categories**: Unexpected spending areas
- **Discretionary vs. Essential**: How much flexibility you have
- **Category trends**: Growing or shrinking over time

**Action Items:**
- Set budgets for top 5 categories
- Create rules to auto-categorize future transactions
- Identify categories to reduce

**Example Insights:**
```
Category Breakdown (Last 3 Months):
- Housing: $3,600 (40%)
- Food & Dining: $1,200 (13%)
- Transportation: $900 (10%)
- Entertainment: $600 (7%)
- Shopping: $800 (9%)
- Other: $1,900 (21%)

Total: $9,000
```

**AI Query:**
```
"Show me my spending by category for the last 3 months,
and highlight which categories increased vs last quarter"
```

### 2. Merchant Analysis

**Purpose:** Identify where you shop most and potential savings

**How to:**
1. Go to **Transactions** → filter by Merchant
2. Sort by total amount spent
3. View transaction count per merchant

**What to Look For:**
- **Top merchants**: Where you spend most
- **Frequency**: How often you visit each merchant
- **Subscription services**: Recurring charges from same merchant
- **Duplicate services**: Multiple subscriptions for similar services

**Action Items:**
- Negotiate better rates with top merchants
- Cancel unused subscriptions
- Consolidate duplicate services
- Set up alerts for large merchant charges

**Example Analysis:**
```
Top Merchants (Last Month):
1. Amazon: $450 (15 transactions) - ~$30/transaction
2. Whole Foods: $380 (12 transactions) - ~$32/transaction
3. Shell Gas: $240 (8 transactions) - ~$30/transaction
4. Netflix: $15 (1 transaction) - Subscription
5. Spotify: $10 (1 transaction) - Subscription
```

**AI Query:**
```
"Which merchants do I spend the most at, and how many
transactions do I have with each in the last year?"
```

### 3. Time-Based Analysis

**Purpose:** Identify spending patterns over time

**How to:**
1. Use the date range selector in Reports
2. Compare different time periods
3. Look at trends month-over-month, year-over-year

**What to Look For:**
- **Seasonal patterns**: Higher spending in certain months
- **Anomalies**: Unusual spikes or dips
- **Growth trends**: Increasing/decreasing spending over time
- **Day-of-week patterns**: Do you spend more on weekends?

**Action Items:**
- Plan for seasonal expenses (holidays, vacations)
- Investigate anomalies (one-time purchases vs. ongoing issues)
- Set goals to reduce trending increases
- Adjust budgets based on historical patterns

**Example Patterns:**
```
Monthly Spending Trend:
Jan: $8,500
Feb: $7,200 (Holiday recovery)
Mar: $9,100
Apr: $12,300 (Tax payment + vacation)
May: $8,800
Jun: $9,200

Average: $9,183/month
```

**AI Query:**
```
"Show me my monthly spending for the last year and identify
which months were highest and why"
```

### 4. Budget vs. Actual Analysis

**Purpose:** Track adherence to financial goals

**How to:**
1. Set up budgets for key categories
2. Monitor budget progress throughout the month
3. Review budget reports at month-end

**What to Look For:**
- **Over-budget categories**: Where you're overspending
- **Under-budget categories**: Potential to reallocate funds
- **Consistent misses**: Budgets that are unrealistic
- **Success stories**: Categories where you stay on track

**Action Items:**
- Adjust unrealistic budgets
- Set alerts before exceeding budgets
- Celebrate wins in on-track categories
- Reallocate savings from under-budget categories

**Example Report:**
```
Budget Performance (This Month):
Category        Budget    Actual    Variance
Groceries       $600      $720      -$120 (20% over)
Dining Out      $300      $180      +$120 (40% under)
Entertainment   $200      $250      -$50 (25% over)
Gas             $250      $235      +$15 (6% under)
```

**AI Query:**
```
"Which budget categories am I over or under this month,
and by how much?"
```

### 5. Discretionary vs. Essential Spending

**Purpose:** Understand how much flexibility you have

**How to:**
1. Tag transactions as "Essential" or "Discretionary"
2. Or categorize appropriately:
   - **Essential**: Housing, utilities, insurance, groceries, healthcare
   - **Discretionary**: Dining out, entertainment, shopping, hobbies

**What to Look For:**
- **Essential percentage**: Ideally 50-60% of income
- **Discretionary percentage**: Room for savings or cutting back
- **Reducing essentials**: Can you negotiate bills, refinance, etc.?
- **Optimizing discretionary**: Where to cut if needed

**Action Items:**
- Aim for 50/30/20 rule: 50% essential, 30% discretionary, 20% savings
- Identify discretionary items to reduce
- Negotiate essential expenses (insurance, phone, internet)

**Example Breakdown:**
```
Monthly Spending Breakdown:
Essential: $5,400 (60%)
  - Housing: $2,000
  - Utilities: $300

  - Dining Out: $600
  - Entertainment: $400
  - Shopping: $800
  - Hobbies: $300
  - Travel: $1,500

Total: $9,000
Savings Rate: 10% of income
```

**AI Query:**
```
"Break down my spending into essential and discretionary
categories, and tell me what percentage is each"
```

### 6. One-Time vs. Recurring Analysis

**Purpose:** Understand baseline spending vs. anomalies

**How to:**
1. Mark one-time transactions (vacation, large purchase, medical bill)
2. View "average spending" excluding one-time items
3. Identify recurring transactions (subscriptions, bills)

**What to Look For:**
- **True baseline spending**: Monthly average excluding one-time items
- **Recurring costs**: Total monthly commitments
- **Subscription creep**: Growing number of recurring charges
- **One-time spikes**: Budget for upcoming irregular expenses

**Action Items:**
- Calculate true average monthly spend
- Review all recurring charges for necessity
- Plan for upcoming one-time expenses
- Create a "one-time expense" fund

**Example Analysis:**
```
Last 6 Months Spending:
Total: $54,000
Average: $9,000/month

One-Time Expenses: $6,000
  - Vacation: $3,000
  - Car Repair: $1,500
  - Medical Bill: $1,500

Baseline Average: $8,000/month
Recurring Charges: $1,200/month
  - Rent: $2,000
  - Utilities: $300
  - Subscriptions: $150
  - Insurance: $400
  - Loan Payments: $350
```

**AI Query:**
```
"What are all my recurring charges, and what do they total per month?"
```

## Advanced Analysis Techniques

### 1. Spending Velocity

**What:** How quickly you spend money after receiving income

**How to Measure:**
1. Track days between paycheck and running low on funds
2. Calculate daily burn rate
3. Monitor cash flow timing

**Insights:**
- Fast spending velocity = potential cash flow issues
- Slow velocity = good buffer, potential to invest earlier

**AI Query:**
```
"How many days does it typically take me to spend my paycheck?"
```

### 2. Merchant Concentration

**What:** How dependent you are on specific merchants

**How to Measure:**
1. Calculate percentage of spending at top 3 merchants
2. Identify single-merchant dependence (e.g., Amazon for everything)

**Insights:**
- High concentration = opportunity to shop around
- Diversification might yield better prices or rewards

**AI Query:**
```
"What percentage of my total spending goes to my top 3 merchants?"
```

### 3. Category Correlation

**What:** How certain spending categories move together

**How to Analyze:**
1. Compare month-to-month changes in related categories
2. Example: Dining Out ↑ often coincides with Entertainment ↑

**Insights:**
- Identify spending triggers (eating out → more spending overall)
- Bundle category budgets that correlate

**AI Query:**
```
"When I spend more on dining out, do I also tend to spend more
on entertainment?"
```

### 4. Income vs. Expense Trends

**What:** How spending grows relative to income

**How to Measure:**
1. Track expense growth rate
2. Compare to income growth rate
3. Calculate savings rate trend

**Insights:**
- Expenses growing faster than income = unsustainable
- Savings rate declining = lifestyle creep

**Example:**
```
2023 vs 2024:
Income: $75k → $82k (+9.3%)
Expenses: $60k → $72k (+20%)
Savings Rate: 20% → 12.2%

⚠️ Lifestyle creep detected!
```

**AI Query:**
```
"Compare my income growth vs expense growth over the last 2 years"
```

### 5. Per-Capita or Per-Day Analysis

**What:** Normalize spending by household size or time period

**How to:**
1. Divide category spending by household members (e.g., groceries per person)
2. Calculate daily spending rate
3. Compare to benchmarks

**Insights:**
- Per-capita groceries: Are you above/below average?
- Daily spending: Target amount to stay on budget

**Example:**
```
Household: 2 people
Groceries: $800/month
Per-Capita: $400/person/month (~$13/person/day)

National Average: ~$300/person/month
Status: 33% above average
```

**AI Query:**
```
"What's my daily average spending across all categories?"
```

## Using Rules for Automated Analysis

### Auto-Tagging for Analysis

Create rules to automatically tag transactions for later analysis:

**Examples:**
- Tag all weekend transactions as "Weekend Spending"
- Tag transactions over $100 as "Large Purchase"
- Tag transactions at specific merchants as "Online Shopping"

**Benefits:**
- Easy filtering for analysis
- Trend tracking (e.g., weekend spending over time)
- Budget management (e.g., limit large purchases)

### Exclusion Rules

Mark certain transactions to exclude from reports:

**Examples:**
- Transfers between your own accounts
- Reimbursable expenses
- One-time anomalies
- Test transactions

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner spending reports
- Accurate budget tracking
- Better averages and trends

## Benchmarking Your Spending

### National Averages (US, 2024)

Use these as rough benchmarks:

| Category | % of Income | Typical Amount (at $75k income) |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Housing | 30-35% | $1,875 - $2,188 |
| Transportation | 15-20% | $938 - $1,250 |
| Food | 10-15% | $625 - $938 |
| Healthcare | 5-8% | $313 - $500 |
| Entertainment | 5-7% | $313 - $438 |
| Savings | 10-20% | $625 - $1,250 |

**Note:** These vary significantly by location, lifestyle, and family size.

**AI Query:**
```
"How does my spending breakdown compare to typical percentages?"
```

### The 50/30/20 Rule

A popular budgeting framework:
- **50% Needs**: Essentials (housing, food, utilities, insurance, minimum debt payments)
- **30% Wants**: Discretionary (dining out, entertainment, hobbies, non-essential shopping)
- **20% Savings**: Emergency fund, investments, extra debt payments

**How to Check:**
```
"Calculate my 50/30/20 breakdown based on last month's spending"
```

## Tips for Better Insights

### 1. Consistent Categorization

- **Use the same categories** for similar transactions
- **Create rules** to automate categorization
- **Review uncategorized transactions** regularly

### 2. Meaningful Merchants

- **Consolidate merchant names** (e.g., "Amazon.com", "AMZN", "Amazon Prime" → "Amazon")
- **Use AI enhancement** via Rules with "Auto Detect Merchants" action (see [AI Integration](ai-integration.md#2-merchant-enhancement-auto-detect-merchants))
- **Be specific** where it matters (different restaurants, not just "Restaurant")

### 3. Detailed Notes

- **Add notes** to unusual transactions
- **Explain one-time purchases** for future reference
- **Tag reimbursable expenses** immediately

### 4. Regular Reviews

- **Weekly**: Quick scan for errors and anomalies
- **Monthly**: Full analysis and budget review
- **Quarterly**: Trend analysis and goal assessment
- **Annually**: Big picture review and planning

### 5. Set Specific Goals

Instead of "spend less", try:
- **"Reduce dining out by 20% ($120/month)"**
- **"Keep groceries under $600/month"**
- **"Increase savings rate from 15% to 20%"**

Then use Sure's AI to track progress:
